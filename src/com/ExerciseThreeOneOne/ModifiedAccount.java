/*3.11 (Modified Account Class) Modify class Account (Fig. 3.8) to provide a method called withdraw
        that withdraws money from an Account. Ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed
        the Accountâ€™s balance. If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the method should print
        a message indicating "Withdrawal amount exceeded account balance." Modify class AccountTest
        (Fig. 3.9) to test method withdraw.
